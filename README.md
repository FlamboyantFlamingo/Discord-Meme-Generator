# Discord-Meme-Generator
This program is built to allow discord users to type a command and then fill in top/bottom text. 
This image will be created and then posted in the channel that the message came from.

## Current Functionality
* Bot can search for images based on the `memetype` arg.
* Bot can send the newly created meme to discord. 
* Bot will not crash under user inputs.
* Log will be created upon usage or predefined error.

## TODO
* Formatting for memes that are not just top and bottom text.
  * Ex. Batman slapping Robin meme. 
  * This is a side project in itself
* Set character limit.
* Add text wrapping. 


## Getting Started
This bot is not currently public. Once I can host it properly, and not from my desktop, I will make it public.

## Built With
* [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) - Discord API wrapper to run a discord bot in Python
* [Pillow] (https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/3.0.x/index.html)
